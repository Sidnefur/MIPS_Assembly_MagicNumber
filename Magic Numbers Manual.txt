The Magic Numbers Game is a MIPS Assembly based game where the player picks a 
number from 0 to 63, answers some questions, and (with a little magic) then has
their number given back to them! 

This game is run by opening the MagicNumbers.asm file in MARS, and then
selecting the assemble button (the icon of a wrench crossed with a screwdriver).
If the program is opened and assembled with no errors, the game can be started 
by pressing the green play button. 

The game will begin with a greeting and then asks the player to pick a number 
from 0-63 (meaning 0 and 63 can be chosen as well). To guess this number, it 
will then generate a series of cards in a random order. Each card will contain
32 numbers, and if the player's number is in that card, they input 'y', or 'n'
if it is not. The first card will be generated right away, but there's no 
time constraint on the player! 

*If the player enters anything other than these two characters here, it will 
kindly ask them to input one of the selected characters. 

After answering truthfully through the 6 random cards, the player's number
will be given back to them!

Finally, the game will ask the player if they would like to play again. They
can then input 'y' to start over, or 'n' to end the game. 

*If the player enters anything other than these two characters here, it will 
also kindly ask them to input one of the selected characters.
